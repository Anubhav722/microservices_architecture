code is organised into bounded contexts
code related to a specific business domain or function is in one place
clear boundaries with clear interfaces between each

- convert bounded contexts into microservices
-- start off with one


prioritize what to split first:
- by risk (which will have least impact)

incremental approach:
integrating with the monolithic
-- monitor both for impact
-- monitor operations that talk to microservices
-- review and improve infrastructure
