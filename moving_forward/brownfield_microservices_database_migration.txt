avoid shared databases

split databases using seams:
- relate tables to code seams
- 

supporting the existing application:
- data layer that connects to multiple databases

tables that link across seams:
- API calls that can fetch that data for a relationship

refactor database into multiple databases

data referential integrity (for example cascading: can be done by microservices talking to each other)

static data tables (reqd. by all microservices): should be placed in a config file and should be available to all microservices

shared data: same as for static data tables.
