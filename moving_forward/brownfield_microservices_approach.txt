our existing monolithic system

existing system:
- monolithic system
- seems large to split

lacks microservices design principles
- start by splitting the domains within the code. separation which reflects domain
- by grouping the code, we are identifying bounded contexts.
- refactoring the code and splitting the dependencies

start modularising the bounded contexts
- move code incrementally
