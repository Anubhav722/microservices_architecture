using virtual machines as a host
virtual machines are basically entire instances of operating systems running on hardware which is simulated into software.

we can basically clone multiple copies of virtual machines

foundation of cloud platforms
- platform as a service (PAAS) they can provide you with entire infrastructure through cloud services to run the microservices architecture.
-- microsoft azure
-- aws
-- your own cloud (for example vSphere) - clouds which we host on physical machines

could be more efficient
- takes time to setup
- takes time to load
- take quite bit of a resource


unique features:
- take snapshot of a virtual machine
- clone instances
