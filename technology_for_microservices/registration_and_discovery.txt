when we need to connect to a microservice we need to know where the microservice is

where ?
- host, port, and version


1. SERVICE REGISTRY DATABASE
when we implement new microservices or when we create new instances to meet demand. on startup of these microservices register themselves on this database.
-- register service on database
-- deregister service on failure
-- cloud platforms (AWS, azure) makes it easy.
-- local platform registration options.
--- self registration
--- third party registration
-- local platform discovery options
--- client side discovery
--- server-side discovery (when a gateway or load balancer is used)
