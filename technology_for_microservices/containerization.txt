type of virutalization

-unlike virtualization, they do not run entire os within the container.
-they run the minimal amout required to run your service.
-good way of "isolating services from each other", more stable and secure
- single service per container
- different to a virtual machine
-- use less resource than a VM.
-- faster than VM.
-- quicker to create new instances

future of hosted applications
cloud platform support growing
mainly linux based

not as established as virtual machines
-- not standardised
-- limited features and tooling
-- infrastructure support in its infancy
-- complex to setup
