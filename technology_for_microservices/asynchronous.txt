event based communication

- mitigates the need of client and service availability.
- decouples client and service.

uses message queuing protocol.
where the events are created by the service as messages are seen as publisher and the service that carries out task in response to these messages is seen as a subscriber.


these messages are buffered by a messsage broker until a subscriber picks these messages up.
the subscriber and publisher only know about the message broker. they are decoupled from each other.
