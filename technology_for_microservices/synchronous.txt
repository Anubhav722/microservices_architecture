request-response communication
- client to service
- service to service
- service to external

they wait for the response

technologies used:
1. one of the technology types we can use here is RPC (Remote procedure call).
allows us to create distributed client-server programs.
hides the fact that we are communicating over a network. (almost like a function call)

2. we can also use HTTP here.


issues with synchronous communication:
- both parties have to be available.
- performance subject to network quality.
